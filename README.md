## Note about Medium
They have [their rules](https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4) posted online and are very easy to access. I broke multiple rules with the content I created.

## Some rules I broke (there are probably more tbh)

### Deceptive conduct

> Donâ€™t use deception to generate revenue or traffic

The offending post was titled, "Do You Have Anxiety? Depression? Try This!" In this post, I suggest my ReduxX library would solve anxiety and depression. That was definitely deceptive, and it also breaks the next rule!

### Ads, Promotions, and Marketing

> Third-party advertising and sponsorships are not allowed. You may not advertise or promote third-party products, services, or brands through Medium posts, publications, or letters.

All of my content linked here breaks this rule.

### Spam

I broke multiple rules here.

> Posting content primarily to drive traffic to, or increase the search rankings of, an external site, product, or service

> Posting duplicate content, whether from a single account or across multiple accounts

> Repeatedly using responses or other interactions as a method of promotion

> Repeatedly using responses or other interactions as a method of promotion

In [this comment](thanks-for-sharing-your-experiences-of-men-putting-their-penises-in-your-vagina), I started by saying, "Thanks for sharing your experiences of men putting their penises in your vagina," and continued to promote my ReduxX library. Completely irrelevant, and just plain gross.

In [another comment](while-you-are-putting-penises-in-your-vagina-mouth-and-ass-consider-telling-your-partner-s), I started by saying "While you are putting penises in your vagina, mouth, and ass, consider telling your partners," and continued to promote my ReduxX library. Also irrelevant, gross, and I guess I can't stop repeating myself.

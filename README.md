Aren’t you sick of all these men getting away with so many unpunished crimes?
Even in the most economically grounded countries in our world issues of sexual harassment, misogyny, and rape are still occurring on a daily basis.
It’s almost impossible (if not impossible) to find a woman that has not been a victim of these malicious behaviours.

Seriously, what… the… fuck.

It’s almost 2020, and so many men are still committing these crimes, and most of the time they aren’t even considered crimes by our society. When they are considered crimes, the victims often are blamed and are looked down upon.
Let’s be clear about that, bringing a girl into the world in 2020 implies you are bringing a human being into the world that will have a high chance of being the victim of discrimination at the hands of around 50% of the population.
Not all men are bad, but many are and we need to do something about this because clearly our system isn’t working.


## Call to Action for a Better World:


Any type of sexual harassment or malevolence directed towards women needs to be considered a criminal offence and the punishments need to be severe to deter the criminal men.

In school, boys need to take mandatory classes where they learn about the history of the oppression of women, and they also need to learn not to abuse women. These classes will have strict tests they need to pass to ensure every boy knows very concretely not to be a criminal in regards to girls and to women.

Before men go off to university/college/career (after high school), they need be sent to mandatory education camps to make sure that when they do go off into the world, they don’t become rapists and they don’t commit other crimes towards women.

This won’t happen overnight although it can be accomplished and I think it should be done. These actions should be taken because for the past thousands of years women have been oppressed, and things haven’t truly changed. Despite numerous attempts of governments to pretend and to say they are doing something about the problems women face in our society, in reality the government is just saying they’re taking action to get votes, they don’t really care about women’s issues. If governments did care, we wouldn’t have the problems we face now.


Go to your local government and propose these changes. If they aren’t willing make these changes exactly to this degree, then you need to take action into your own hands. First thing, consider if it’s possible to create a local government party so that you can make these changes happen. It might not be possible for whatever reason, maybe even if the government would allow these exact changes it would take years and years for it happen. So we need to figure out an alternate way. Build your wealth and your power within your society and create “inner-societies” within your country where the rules are fair for women (like described above in the call to action). These communities can connect together and eventually what will happen is that the whole world will see how advanced these societies are, simply as a result of women being treated fairly in these societies. The rest of the world will quickly follow this way. This will bring about a quick and a highly-effective way to change the world for the better so that women don’t have to live in fear.
